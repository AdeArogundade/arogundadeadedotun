> Ethos

As a graduate student working in the laboratory, I am dedicated to fostering an environment that prioritizes safety, inclusivity, and support for all members. I firmly believe that building camaraderie among lab colleagues is essential for maximizing our collective potential and productivity. By promoting diversity, equity, and mutual respect, I aim to establish/contribute to a collaborative atmosphere where everyone feels valued, empowered, and motivated to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. With a shared commitment to our common goals, we can address complex scientific challenges, foster innovation, and generate impactful contributions to our field and society at large.
