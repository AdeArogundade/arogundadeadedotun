> About Me

Hi and welcome! My name is Adedotun A. Arogundade. I am a master's student and a member of the [Bittleston Lab](https://www.bittlestonlab.com/) at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/). My research interest is in microbial ecology, I believe that understanding the relationship between plants and microbes is pivotal for ensuring plant health and overall ecosystem functioning. Using cutting-edge genomic and bioinformatic tools, my research focuses on studying these interactions to develop innovative strategies for harnessing beneficial microbial communities.
