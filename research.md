### Exploring sagebrush microbial metagenomes from deep, host-derived sequencing

We used host-derived Illumina shotgun sequences of big sagebrush (_Artemisia tridentata_ subsp. _tridentata_) to explore metagenomes of leaf-associated microbes that were sequenced along with their host. The objectives of this study were to ​​profile the microbial taxa associated with big sagebrush leaves, reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) where possible, and study the potential functions of the resulting MAGs.
